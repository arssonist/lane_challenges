<h1> React Photo Uploader </h1>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is version 1.0 of a photo uploader app built using React

About: 

This project attempts to execute the following-

- upload a single photo onto the page.
- perform various edits to the photo.
- record each of these edits in a history.
- be able to undo edits made.
- be able to preview an example of the photo with the edits applied.
- be able to reset the program to itâ€™s starting point.

Due to the constraints of the assignment it was necessary to rely on npm. This project consists of two imported React packages, Dropzone, used to import the photo, and React-Avatar-Editor, used to edit the photo.
